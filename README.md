# SweetCamera
Sweet API for working with android camera

# Motivation
Dealing with camera is fun when you do it for the first time but it gets tiresome and repetitive the 3rd time.  
Our apps deserve better!  
We want to do so many great and beautiful things with our cameras and there are so many ideas to implement that we often forget 
how hard it really is to actually get some pixels running on the screen.  
After reinventing the wheel a couple of times, I decided to put everything that I've learned into an easy to use library so
we can benefit all from it!

## Principles 
1. Easy to use but feature complete
2. Fail fast and hard to misuse
3. Keep it asynchronous
4. Mantainable
5. Easy to extend
